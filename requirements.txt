Meal Planner with Grocery List App: Development Document
Overview
The Meal Planner with Grocery List App is designed to simplify meal planning and grocery shopping. It helps users create weekly meal plans, manage grocery lists, track pantry inventory, and monitor budgets while adhering to dietary preferences and restrictions. This document outlines the technical implementation for the web application version of the app.
Objectives
1. Build a responsive web application for meal planning and grocery list management.
2. Ensure the app provides personalized experiences for users based on their preferences and habits.
3. Integrate APIs and AI for efficient recipe suggestions, budget tracking, and grocery list generation.
4. Maintain scalability and modularity for future feature additions.
